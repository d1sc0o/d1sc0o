<summary>ponytown info !!</summary>
please come sit with me in ponytown!! I absolutely love it. I'm rarely sitting with someone, but if I am, feel free to sit with us!

I'm usually sitting below the bakery, in the top left corner of spawn, or in the roblox area on the hills above the docks. I'm also always on safe server #1

if you are 18+ please do not make sexual jokes around me! If you are -16, then go ahead idrc, and if you're -11, just..no :( 
I don't care if you're a proshipper just please don't talk about your ships or ANY ships unless I say you can. Same with spawnism.
I can block / unfriend freely and without explanation.

Ô∏∂Ô∏∂Ô∏∂Ô∏∂I'm almost never the first to interact, i get wayy too nervous especially if I think you're cool. And I think almost everyone is cool. Despite that, don't be intimidated!! I don't bite :) Ô∏∂Ô∏∂Ô∏∂Ô∏∂

‚ï∞‚îà‚û§I also go offtab a lot, so I may not see whispers for a while. If we're having a conversation and we don't talk for a bit, I probably got distracted by something. I'm warning you that I am an extremely awkward person. Also, I don't use tonetags unless asked.
